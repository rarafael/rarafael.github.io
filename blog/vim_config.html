  <h1>Vim Config Stuff</h1>
  <p style="font-size:14px;text-align:left;"><a href="../index.html">home</a></p>
  <p style="font-size:14px;text-align:center;">[08/08/2023]</p>
  <p>
    The recent <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/vim_announce/c/tWahca9zkt4">passing of Bram Moolenaar</a>,
    the original creator of <a href="https://www.vim.org">Vim</a> and it's maintainer, has been one of the
    most unfortunate events of the year in the area of technology so far. Bram was probably one of the most 
    influential software engineers and his editor defined a lot of decisions that would shape the editors
    used by most people nowadays.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'll introduce here some interesting bits of Vim/<a href="https://neovim.io">NeoVim</a> configuration that
    I find very useful on a daily basis.
  </p>

  <h2>paragraph browsing</h2>
  <p>
    Vim has paragraph browsing embedded into it and mapped to } and { (see <a href="https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#%7B">the help pages</a>).
    If you're not an US keyboard user however, this keybind is quite unintuitive, for example: in my ABNT2
    keyboard, the } and { are mapped one on top of another.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size:14px;">
    <img src="../resources/abnt2_keys.webp" alt="} and { on ABNT2"><br>
    <i>} and { on ABNT2</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    My simple solution to this is to remap these keys to J and K (<i>capital j and k</i>). 
    <code><pre>
noremap J }
noremap K {
    </pre></code>
    Not only are they
    easier to reach and more intuitive, the original keybinds are not particularly useful. <a href="https://vimhelp.org/change.txt.html#J">J</a>
    merges your current line with the top one, which is not something that I find occurs very often.
    <a href="https://vimhelp.org/various.txt.html#K">K</a> tries to open a manpage referent to the word under
    your cursor. While this might've been useful in the past, when libraries were mostly documented through
    manpages, nowadays a lot of programs have only HTML documentations available (and Doxygen is
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15129452/can-doxygen-be-coerced-into-creating-decent-man-pages">notorously
    terrible at generating proper man output</a>).
  </p>

  <h2>ease of use keybinds</h2>
  <p>
    There are a couple of keybinds I find add just that little bit more convenience that makes the editor
    so much more pleasant to use. In this section, I'll give a couple of examples:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>switching ':' for ';'</b>
        <p>
          You probably aren't aware of what ; even does inside Vim. In short, it repeats a textual find motion.
          <code><pre>
noremap ; :
noremap : ;
          </pre></code>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>easier scrolling with 'gj' and 'gk'</b>
        <p>
          Normally, j and k browse through lines, which means if there's line wrapping you'll jump straight up
          to the next line regards of what your display line is. I find that this is mostly unwanted behaviour,
          so this rebinds it to gj and gk (which browse in display lines).
          <code><pre>
noremap j gj
noremap k gk
          </pre></code>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>command forking with '!'</b>
        <p>
          This one is just a simple rebind to make forking commands inside of the Vim shell easier.
          <code><pre>
noremap ! :!
          </pre></code>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>disable history lookup</b>
        <p>
          I'm possibly not alone in this, but history look-up is annoying. I find that when I do need to find
          a command I recently executed, simply pressing &lt;Up> while inside the command prompt is more convenient
          than finding it on the history tab, and whenever I do open it up it is by accident. Therefore I disable
          opening it entirely to solve the issue.
          <code><pre>
noremap q: &lt;nop>
noremap &lt;C-f> &lt;nop>
          </pre></code>
        </p>
      </li>

    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>man page</h2>
  <p>
    Lastly, if you've disabled K and remapped it to something else, there's another way of getting manpage access inside of
    Vim: the <code>Man</code> command. Using <code>:Man [pagename]</code> opens up a shell window with a manpage.
    Personally, I find a vertical window more pleasant to look at (since horizontal will cut your screen in half, and
    most code that you'll use manpages inside, C and C++, will have some sort of line limit at 80 or 100).
    <code><pre>
noremap &lt;Leader>m :vertical :Man 
    </pre></code>
    You'll need the filetype plugin to enable this behaviour, but enabling it is simple enough, put this at the top
    of your <code>.vimrc</code> if you haven't already
    <code><pre>
filetype plugin on
    </pre></code>
  </p>

  <h2>conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Vim is a very flexible editor that allows itself to mold to one's requirements. While some behaviour might not
    be default, it is not hard to implement them inside a <code>.vimrc</code> that makes the editing experience
    much more pleasant. I believe one of Vim's main strongpoints and why it has remained one of the most used editors
    throughout all the years, besides it's well documented keymapping, is it's extensive customisability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Vim charityware's nature also makes it special. The project's main goal is to raise funds for <a href="https://iccf-holland.org/">ICCF Holland</a>.
    This goes to show the extent of Bram's mentality towards his own creation, and makes his missing presence going
    forward ever more absent in a sea of for-profit and ad-ridden software.
